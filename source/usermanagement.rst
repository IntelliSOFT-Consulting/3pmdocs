User Management
=====================

The User Management App in 3PM allows for multiiple users to access the system simultaneously - each with a defined set of permissions. These permissions can vary from allowing users who only enter data, to those who can generate reports. Several user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users, who can access the system based on those roles. A user can access this module from the Apps Menu, by searching the Users App as shown:

The procedure below shows the process of adding a new user and assigning them their relevant roles.
