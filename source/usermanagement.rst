User Management
=====================

User Management feature in 3PM allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously. 
Each user is given a defined set of authorities. 
Examples of these authorities including data entry, performing data approval and deleting users. 

These authorities are assigned to users through user roles. A user role is a set of defined authorities. 
We have four user roles on 3PM as follows:

#. Read Only - for viewing but not making any changes, addition or deletion of data.
#. Data entry -  for monthly reporting through the datasets.
#. Data Approval - for approving data entered per Implementing Mechanism.
#. User Management - for creation, deletion and modification of users.

The user management functionality is accessible through Users app;

Add user group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users are grouped into a user group for ease of sharing items such as the dashboard in 3PM. The pictorial below will quickly guide you through creating a user group and adding users to it.
