Reports and Analytics
=====================

The Report generating module in 3PM allows users to generate standard reports and visualize them. Reports can be generated using the Pivot Table which generates tabular reports, and the Data Visualizer which generates reports in form of charts eg. bar graphs and line graphs. A user can access either the Data Visualizer or the Pivot Table from the Apps Menu as shown below.
